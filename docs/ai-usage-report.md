# AI Usage Report

## Assignment 1 - Personal Portfolio Website

This report documents how I used AI tools to learn and get guidance while building this portfolio website.

## 1. Tools Used & Use Cases

### GitHub Copilot

I used Copilot to ask questions about:

- How to structure HTML sections properly
- CSS property names and syntax
- JavaScript method names and event handling

It provided autocomplete suggestions that I reviewed and modified as needed.

### ChatGPT

I asked ChatGPT questions about:

- "How do I make a responsive navigation bar?"
- "What's the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox?"
- "How does localStorage work for saving theme preferences?"
- "What regex pattern validates email addresses?"
- "How do I implement smooth scrolling in JavaScript?"
- "How should I structure the README and documentation files?"

ChatGPT explained concepts and showed examples that I used as learning references to write my own code.

**Documentation Assistance**: AI also helped me write the README and technical documentation by providing structure suggestions and helping me organize the content clearly.

## 2. Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits

- Faster learning by getting quick explanations of concepts
- Understanding best practices through examples
- Learning proper syntax and methods
- Getting unstuck when facing errors

### Challenges

- Sometimes explanations were too generic
- Had to ask follow-up questions for clarity
- Needed to test and verify information independently
- Had to adapt explanations to my specific needs

## 3. Learning Outcomes

### Technical Skills

- Learned HTML5 semantic elements and structure
- Understood CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Practiced JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation
- Implemented form validation and localStorage
- Created responsive designs with media queries

### Problem-Solving

- Learned to break down complex features into smaller tasks
- Practiced debugging by testing code step by step
- Improved at researching and asking specific questions
- Developed better understanding of how things work

## 4. Responsible Use & Modifications

I used AI tools responsibly by:

- Asking questions to understand concepts, not just copy code
- Writing my own code based on what I learned
- Testing all features to ensure they work correctly
- Modifying and customizing based on my needs
- Making sure I understood everything I implemented
- Using AI suggestions for documentation structure while reviewing and adapting the content

All code in this project was written by me after learning from AI explanations and examples. Documentation was structured with AI assistance but reflects my actual work and learning process.

---

## 5. Conclusion

AI tools helped me learn faster by providing explanations and examples when I had questions. Instead of spending hours searching documentation, I could ask specific questions and get quick guidance. However, I still had to write, test, and understand all the code myself. This combination of AI-assisted learning and hands-on practice helped me build this portfolio effectively while developing real skills.
